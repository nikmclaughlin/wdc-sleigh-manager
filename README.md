# ðŸŽ„ðŸ“¦ Sleigh Manager

> It's 2024 and the image you have of Christmas cheer being delivered by one old elf in a sleigh is a relic of the past. Santa is running the world's most advanced logistics operation (take that, Bezos) to deliver the magic for a new generation.
>
> Sleigh Manager puts you in the dispatch center for the North Pole's fleet of delivery sleighs as toy delivery orders come in from an endless torrent of letters to The Big Man. Assign orders to your sleighs as they come in and play your part in optimizing Christmas efficiency.

A silly Christmas app made for the [LWJ Web Dev Challenge](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/web-dev-challenge-hackathon-s1e10-workshop-woes).

## Gameplay
Select orders as they come in and then click on a sleigh to assign them. 
Once a sleigh is loaded, you can click it's 'dispatch' button to send it off on the delivery.
Each sleigh has it's own carrying capacity and flight speed - assign orders carefully to optimize delivery efficiency!

## TODO
This was built as a ~4-hr hackathon project, with more time I'd like to
- [ ] Fine-tune order generation to come in batches
- [ ] Give points for completed orders
- [ ] Allow players to use points to unlock new sleighs, upgrades, etc.
- [ ] Add additional challenge factors (refueling, repairs, time-sensitive deliveries)
